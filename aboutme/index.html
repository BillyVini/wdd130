    <h2>Vinicius Silva</h2>
    <p>Hi everybody! My name is Vinicius Silva, I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and am excited to be in this class with all of you. I've been married for a little bit more than a year (we're still on our honeymoon) and we've been thinking about growing our family already hahaha! I love my family and I'm so grateful for all the blessings Heavenly Father has given me.</p>
    <p>I'm really close to the end of my Associate in Applied Technology - I hope to finish it by the end of Winter 2023. My first certificate was in Databases, and I'm now completing this one in Computer Programming. The areas I am most excited about working on are Business Intelligence, Data Science, and Software Development. Even though, I am also sure I will learn a lot from this Web Development class.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I like to learn more about investing. I also love playing/watching soccer, going out, and playing chess. Hope we can all have an amazing semester! See you later in the course.</p>
