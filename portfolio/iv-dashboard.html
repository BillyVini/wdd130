                <h3>What is insurance verification?</h3>
                <p>Insurance verification is the process of confirming a patients eligibility and benefits offered by their insurance company before he or she comes to the appointment. This can help healthcare providers to know how to offer a treatment plan to their clients, having a more precise information about how much they will be expected to pay out-of-pocket. It can also help insured people to know what is covered under their plan, what sometimes can prompt them to take better care of their health.</p>

                <h3>My data challenge</h3>
                <p>This was not something I got to know in Brazil. But since I was hired by an American company to realize this process of reaching out to insurance companies on behalf of dental offices to verify their patients coverage, I learned how important this is and began appreciating this job. After some months performing an outstanding job, I was promoted to be an Insurance Verification Team Lead. With my promotion, a new challenge came: “How could I keep track of my teams performance in order to help them grow and help the company to provide a better service to their contracted dental offices?”</p>

                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>At that time, we did not have metrics, a dashboard, or any analytics in place. But from my inner desire to apply these things to make the world better, I implemented a couple solutions that will be presented now.</p>
