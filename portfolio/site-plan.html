      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose with this website is to showcase projects where  I solved real-world problems by using data analyitcs. I also would like to host my resumé and contact information for potential employers/clients</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Potential clients and employers seek to do business with professionals who have relevant experince and the necessary skills. With this website, I'm aiming both the companies that can hire me full-time as the ones that will want me as a freelancer. I believe they will want to see what kind of projects have I done, what was my thought process, how do I present my results, as well as my contact information. They probably will access my website from a desktop or laptop, but I want my website to display properly on any screen.</p>

        <b>Who is Vini Analyst?</b>
      </p>
      <p> I am an Applied Technology Student who is passionate about data and is seeking to apply my analytic skills to find the best solutions for real-world problems. </p>

      <p><b>A little bit of my story</b></p>
      <p> Born and raised in Brazil, I became familiar with very specific problems that constantly made me intrigued. Even before I had tech skills to help me in decision-making, I used to use math and research to get the best of life in the alternatives presented. As I pursued my Associates in Applied Technology through BYU-I online, I came across powerful resources like spreadsheets, SQL, Python, and Power BI, to tackle data questions, find valuable insights and tell stories. My intent with this website is to show you some of the challenges I already faced and how I came up with the most effective solutions from my data analysis.</p>

      <h3>Brazil the Country of Fixed Income</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why Brazil has this title</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brazil is known as the country of fixed income due to the high interest rates offered by the Government in its public bonds. Right now, for example, November 12, 2022, the SELIC bond (which is seen as the most secure investment in the country) offers 13.65% return yearly. According to Infinity Asset Management, in a ranking with 40 countries between developed and emerging, Brazil is the one with the highest real interest (meaning the interest after inflation) in the world. If after this, you feel like investing in Brazil, notice first that there are 3 main options of public bonds, and all of them present different performances depending on the moment the national economy is experiencing.</p>

      <p><b>My data challenge</b></p>
      <p>Thinking about this challenge, I thought, “How can someone without much knowledge about Brazilian market or economy, or without a lot of time to spend studying, make the best decision for the current moment?”. Then, I went on looking for content about how the interest rates are set, how they change from time to time (for the options that do not have a preset return), how inflation behaves in Brazil, and how accurate the predictions made by specialists usually are. I developed an algorithm to process, analyze, and solve all this, giving a very good clue in seconds about what is the best fixed income investment to make. </p>

      <p><b>Introduction to my project</b></p>
      <p>My solution basically scrapes data from the Web – including the official weekly predictions from the economists - using Python and Selenium and then briefly shows the trends and reasoning behind the recommendation. Finally, it uses machine learning to predict the option that needs to be bought as well as the expected real return rate. </p>

      <h3>Insurance Verification Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        <b>What is insurance verification</b>
      </p>
      <p>Insurance verification is the process of confirming a patients eligibility and benefits offered by their insurance company before he or she comes to the appointment. This can help healthcare providers to know how to offer a treatment plan to their clients, having a more precise information about how much they will be expected to pay out-of-pocket. It can also help insured people to know what is covered under their plan, what sometimes can prompt them to take better care of their health.</p>

      <p><b>Problem presentation</b></p>
      <p>This was not something I got to know in Brazil. But since I was hired by an American company to realize this process of reaching out to insurance companies on behalf of dental offices to verify their patients coverage, I learned how important this is and began appreciating this job. After some months performing an outstanding job, I was promoted to be an Insurance Verification Team Lead. With my promotion, a new challenge came: “How could I keep track of my teams performance in order to help them grow and help the company to provide a better service to their contracted dental offices?”</p>

      <p><b>Introduction to the project</b></p>
      <p>At that time, we did not have metrics, a dashboard, or any analytics in place. But from my inner desire to apply these things to make the world better, I implemented a couple solutions that will presented now.</p>
