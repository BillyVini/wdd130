                <h2>A little bit of my story</h2>
                <p>Born and raised in Brazil, I became familiar with very specific problems that constantly made me intrigued. Even before I had tech skills to help me in decision-making, I used to use math and research to get the best of life in the alternatives presented. As I pursued my Associates in Applied Technology through BYU-I online, I came across powerful resources like spreadsheets, SQL, Python, and Power BI, to tackle data questions, find valuable insights and tell stories. My intent with this website is to show you some of the challenges I already faced and how I came up with the most effective solutions from my data analysis.</p>
