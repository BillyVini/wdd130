                <h3>Why does Brazil have this title?</h3>
                <p>Brazil is known as the country of fixed income due to the high interest rates offered by the Government in its public bonds. Right now, for example, November 12, 2022, the SELIC bond (which is seen as the most secure investment in the country) offers 13.65% return yearly. According to Infinity Asset Management, in a ranking with 40 countries between developed and emerging, Brazil is the one with the highest real interest (meaning the interest after inflation) in the world. If after this, you feel like investing in Brazil, notice first that there are 3 main options of public bonds, and all of them present different performances depending on the moment the national economy is experiencing.</p>

                <h3>My data challenge</h3>
                <p>Thinking about this challenge, I thought, “How can someone without much knowledge about Brazilian market or economy, or without a lot of time to spend studying, make the best decision for the current moment?”. Then, I went on looking for content about how the interest rates are set, how they change from time to time (for the options that do not have a preset return), how inflation behaves in Brazil, and how accurate the predictions made by specialists usually are. I developed an algorithm to process, analyze, and solve all this, giving a very good clue in seconds about what is the best fixed income investment to make.</p>

            <div class="solution">
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>My solution basically scrapes data from the Web – including the official weekly predictions from the economists - using Python and Selenium and then briefly shows the trends and reasoning behind the recommendation. Finally, it uses machine learning to predict the option that needs to be bought as well as the expected real return rate.</p>
